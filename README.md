# Modern Dynamics (MD) [Very WIP]
Modern item, fluid and energy transport for Fabric, inspired by Thermal Dynamics.

## Why did you make yet another pipe mod?
* I believe a lot of people are interested in a Thermal Dynamics-like pipe mod.
* I have written instantenous pipes for Modern Industrialization, and I want to try doing non-instantaneous pipes now.
It's a lot more complex, which makes it fun. It will also be a good test for Fabric's Transfer API.

I want the code of MD to be extremely clear, so that anyone with a bit of modding experience can understand how it works in details.

Port to Forge? Maybe when the Fabric version is working.
