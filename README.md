# Modern Dynamics (MD)
Modern item and fluid transport for Fabric, inspired by Thermal Dynamics.

## Status: In development, testing appreciated!
We appreciate people testing out Modern Dynamics, however please expect it to contain bugs and rough edges.
If you want to help, download a build [from GitHub](https://github.com/Technici4n/Modern-Dynamics/releases) and test it out in your world.
If you find any bug or missing feature, please open **one issue per feature/bug** on GitHub,
but **check first that no such issue exists**.

### Why did you make yet another pipe mod?
* We believe a lot of people are interested in a Thermal Dynamics-like pipe mod.
* I (Technici4n) have written instantaneous pipes for Modern Industrialization, and I want to try doing non-instantaneous pipes now.
It's a lot more complex, which makes it fun. It will also be a good test for Fabric's Transfer API.

### Why are you copying Thermal Dynamics?
* Reusing TD's concepts allows us to focus on getting the core logic working for now,
but once the mod is working we will revisit some design decisions to further improve the mod.
* ~~Reusing TD's textures (modified) is allowed by TD's license.~~ Many textures have been updated now. All code is original.

### Port to Forge?
Probably not since Thermal Dynamics should be released for Forge eventually.
